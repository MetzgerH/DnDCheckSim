This project is a windows app for simulating and statistically analyzing [Abilty Checks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AbilityChecks) and [Saving Throws](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows) in [Dungeons and Dragons, Fifth Edition](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules). It provides insight based on the check or save's parameters (relevant [Ability](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AbilityScoresandModifiers), [Skill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Skills), and/or [Tool](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/equipment#Tools)), and even player sample restrictions (only characters of a certain level in a certain [Class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/classes) and/or a certain [Lineage/Species](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/races))
